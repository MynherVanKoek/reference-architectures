# Deploy the AKS Cluster

Now that the [hub-spoke network is provisioned](./04-networking.md), the next step in the [AKS secure Baseline reference implementation](./) is deploying the AKS cluster and its adjacent Azure resources.

## Steps

1. Create the AKS cluster resource group.

   > :book: The app team working on behalf of business unit 0001 (BU001) is looking to create an AKS cluster of the app they are creating (Application ID: 0008). They have worked with the organization's networking team and have been provisioned a spoke network in which to lay their cluster and network-aware external resources into (such as Application Gateway). They took that information and added it to their [`cluster-stamp.json`](./cluster-stamp.json) and [`azuredeploy.parameters.prod.json`](./azuredeploy.parameters.prod.json) files.
   >
   > They create this resource group to be the parent group for the application.

   ```bash
   # [This takes less than one minute.]
   az group create --name rg-bu0001a0008 --location eastus2
   ```

1. Get the AKS cluster spoke VNet resource ID.

   > :book: The app team will be deploying to a spoke VNet, that was already provisioned by the network team.

   ```bash
   TARGET_VNET_RESOURCE_ID=$(az deployment group show -g rg-enterprise-networking-spokes -n spoke-BU0001A0008 --query properties.outputs.clusterVnetResourceId.value -o tsv)
   ```

1. Deploy the cluster ARM template.

   **Option 1 - Deploy in the Azure Portal**

   Use the following deploy to Azure button to create the baseline cluster from the Azure Portal. You'll need to provide the parameter values as returned from prior steps in this guide.

   [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmspnp%2Freference-architectures%2Ffcp%2Faks-baseline%2Faks%2Fsecure-baseline%2Fcluster-stamp.json)

    **Option 2 - Deploy from the command line**

   ```bash
   # [This takes about 15 minutes.]
   az deployment group create --resource-group rg-bu0001a0008 --template-file cluster-stamp.json --parameters targetVnetResourceId=$TARGET_VNET_RESOURCE_ID k8sRbacAadProfileAdminGroupObjectID=$K8S_RBAC_AAD_PROFILE_ADMIN_GROUP_OBJECTID k8sRbacAadProfileTenantId=$K8S_RBAC_AAD_PROFILE_TENANTID appGatewayListenerCertificate=$APP_GATEWAY_LISTENER_CERTIFICATE
   ```

   > Alteratively, you could have updated the [`azuredeploy.parameters.prod.json`](./azuredeploy.parameters.prod.json) file and deployed as above, using `--parameters @azuredeploy.parameters.prod.json` instead of the individual key-value pairs. This is how the [example GitHub Actions workflow](./github-workflow) does it.

## Deploy - Option 3 GitHub Actions (fork is required)

1. Copy the file GitHub workflow into the proper directory

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   cp .github/workflows/aks-deploy.yaml
   ```

1. Open the workflow file `.github/workflows/aks-deploy.yaml` and follow the
   intructions

1. commit the changes to your repo

   ```bash
   git add -u && git commit -m "setup GitHub CD workflow"
   git push origin HEAD:remotes/origin/master
   ```

1. open a PR and once the GitHub wokflow successfully finished, please merge to
   master so the AKS cluster creation will be kicked off
